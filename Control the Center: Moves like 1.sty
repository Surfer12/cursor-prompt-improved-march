Control the Center: Moves like 1.e4 or 1.d4 are very popular because they immediately place a pawn in the center of the board. Controlling the center squares (d4, e4, d5, e5) is crucial as it allows pieces more mobility and influence over the game.
Develop Pieces: The opening phase is also about bringing your knights and bishops off the back rank quickly and efficiently. While the very first move is usually a pawn move, the idea behind it often sets up subsequent piece development.
King Safety: Although not usually the immediate goal of the very first move, the opening strategy aims to prepare for castling relatively early to protect the king.
Flexibility: Some opening moves aim to keep options open, allowing the player to react to the opponent's setup.
So, while I don't "decide" on a move myself, a good first move in chess is typically one that stakes a claim in the center and facilitates the rapid development of pieces. 1.e4 and 1.d4 are classic choices for these reasons.
